# Click_Through_Rate_Prediction

**📌 Project Overview**

This project focuses on predicting whether a user will click on an advertisement based on their behavioral and demographic features. Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is crucial for businesses aiming to optimize their marketing campaigns and target the right audience.

Using a Machine Learning model, we analyzed user characteristics and trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict ad-click behavior with high accuracy.

**🚀 Objectives**

Understand and analyze user behavior related to ad clicks.

Explore relationships between features like daily time spent online, age, income, gender, and internet usage.

Build a Machine Learning model to predict ad clicks.

Achieve a high predictive accuracy through feature engineering and model selection.

**🛠️ Tech Stack**

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, plotly, scikit-learn

Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

**Visualization:**

Plotly Express,

Plotly Graph Objects

**📊 Data Exploration**

Dataset Size: 10,0000 records

Target Variable: Clicked on Ad (Yes / No)

**Features Used:**

Daily Time Spent on Site

Age

Area Income

Daily Internet Usage

Gender (encoded as 0/1)

**📈 Key Findings**

Users spending more time on the site have a higher probability of clicking on ads.

Lower daily internet usage correlates with higher ad-click probability.

Users around the age of 40 years click more on ads compared to younger users.

Higher area income slightly correlates with lower ad click rates.

**🧪 Model Training**

Data Split: 80% training, 20% testing

Model Used: Random Forest Classifier

Accuracy Achieved: 78%

**🎯 Conclusion**

By analyzing and modeling user characteristics, we successfully built a machine learning model that predicts ad-click behavior with over 79% accuracy. Such insights can help businesses optimize their ad placements and marketing strategies to boost engagement and conversions.
